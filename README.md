# MSP Not For Me
The concept of Microsoft Points really annoys the living shit out of me, so I've decided I don't want to see them anymore.  This extension will let you rid yourself of the stupid notion, although it makes little difference to anything else.

### Usage

Just go about your normal business and you should find that whenever you're looking at xbox live purchases you see them in real monies.

### Contributing?
If you want to contribute to this tiny project, feel free to fork and make a pull request.  It would be nice to get better icons, and obviously you can add more locales so the extension works in more countries.

Why contribute to this repo?  Well I'll push any chances to the chrome extensions website, so everyone can get a taste.

### License?
Please feel free to do absolutely anything you like with this extension.  There's no license at all.  Just go nuts.
